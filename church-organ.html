      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>An account written by Mr. Andrew Leach in 1981, states that there were no references to an organ in Welton Parish Church prior to its restoration by Sir Gilbert Scott in 1862/3. The first recorded account of an organ occurs in the Church Vestry Book for 1884. In this year, a new organ was installed in the church by Booth and Hepworth, however by 1903 plans were drawn up for significant alterations and repairs by the then organist, Mr. Samuel Wilkinson Pilling.</p>
      <p>Appointed 3 years earlier in 1900, Mr. Pilling held the position of honorary organist for 37 years.  Described at the time as England’s greatest amateur organist, he became a Vice-President of Trinity College of Music and the first national president of what is now the Incorporated Association of Organists (https://iao.org.uk). Mr. Pilling was an influential figure in the organ design of the period and was held in high regard by organists the world over. Mr. Pilling had in his home at Welton Hall, what is believed to be the largest privately owned organ in the country. Notable players of the time would visit him in order to play the four manual concert organ, shown here.</p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/PillingOrgan.jpeg" alt="Pilling Organ" />
      <p></p>
      <p>The current church organ was built by Messrs. J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of Ruislip, Middlesex. The cost of the work was kindly paid for by two members of the congregation. Modifications completed, the organ was opened on 3rd September, 1903, and Mr. Pilling played at the inaugural recital. Between 1903 and 1908 further enhancements were made to the tonal scheme of the organ. The organ was partially dismantled in 1916 for cleaning, and again in 1929 when it was also enlarged. In 1957, the organ was totally dismantled, rebuilt, resited and re-opened. A recital was given by Eric Bell, F.R.C.O, Organist at St. Mary’s, Beverley.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Specification</h4>
      <p>The specification below is taken from the 1957 re-opening.</p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/OrganSpecificationApril1957.png" alt="Organ Specification 1957" style="max-width: 75%;" />

      <p></p>
      <h4>Restoration</h4>
      <p>After several years use, it became obvious that some restoration work was required. An estimate was accepted from A.J. Carter of Wakefield, who had previously served the organ on behalf of J.W. Walker & Sons, the work to be done in three phases as funds became available. At the time the Carter firm was given complete charge of the organ in lieu of Walkers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The restoration of the organ took place over 25 years. During that time there were four organists at St.Helen’s: Mr. Andrew Leach; Mr. Ron Jowett; Mr. Gareth Naidoo and Mr. David Lucas. Each contributed to the organ restoration in different ways, as did many members of the choir, congregation and community. We are grateful to all of them for their contributions.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The three phases of the organ restoration were as follows:</p>

      <p></p>
      <h6>Phase 1 – Early 1993</h6>
      <p>The pedal organ was electrified, the pipe work was completely dismantled, thoroughly cleaned and regulated. After a lapse of several years, the 32ff sub-bourdon pipes were again sounding, greatly enhancing the sound of organ generally. This work cost approximately £5,800.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h6>Phase 2 – Late 1994/1995</h6>
      <p>he manual pipework was dismantled. All pipes and upper boards were thoroughly cleaned, the pipes regulated and the five reed stops revoked. At the same time there were some minor modifications made to both the Great and Swell organs. This work cost approximately £7,900.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The specification below is taken from the 1995 documentation.</p>

      <h6>Phase 3 – January to April 2003</h6>
      <p>January to April 2003 saw the 3rd and final phase of the restoration of the organ undertaken. On Saturday 22 November 2003 at 7.30pm (St. Cecilia Day) there was a service in celebration of music at St. Helen’s. The service was lead by Revd. Elaine Bielby, a sermon was given by Most Revd. and Right Hon. Dr David Hope, the then Archbishop of York. The organ was played by Mr. Julian Savory.  The evening service also marked the centenary of the original installation of the organ at St. Helen’s and the completion of the restoration of the organ.</p>

          <p>Mr. Samuel Pilling, November 1931</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>Mr. Pilling was born in 1856 in Bolton. He received his early musical training at Manchester Cathedral. At some point in late 1896 or early 1897, Mr. Pilling was elected as President of the Wakefield & District Organists’ Association. In 1901, he moved from Mirfield to Welton. In 1903, Mr. Pilling drew up the specification for the new Walker organ for St Helen’s. In recognition of Pilling’s significant financial contribution towards the cost of the organ’s erection, the PCC made him the honorary organist of the church. In 1913, Mr. Pilling was elected as the first President of the National Union of Organists’ Associations, which later became the IAO.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pilling served St. Helen’s for a total of 37 years. He died in March 1939, aged 82. His funeral was held at St. Helen’s.</p>
